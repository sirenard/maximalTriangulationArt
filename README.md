# How use the website: 
<https://sirenard.github.io/maximaltriangulationart/index.html>
1. Draw some points in order to shape convex polygon
2. Click on solve and see the result of the maximum-area triangulation and minimum-area triangle enclosed algorithms
3. If you want to see the algorithms of Dobkin & Snyder you can click on a dedicated button 
which lead to an other web page. 
4. On this webpage you can draw yourself as before a convex polygon 
5. Or you can directly generate a polygon where the algorithm of Dobkin & Snyder fails.
6. Click on the screen to see each step of the algorithm and at the end, compare this largest triangle with correct one 
(both can be the same if you draw yourself the polygon).
