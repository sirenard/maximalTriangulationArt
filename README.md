# How use the website: 
<https://sirenard.github.io/maximaltriangulationart>
1. Draw some points in order to shape convex polygon and click on solve
2. See the result of the maximum-area triangulation and minimum-area triangle enclosed algorithms
3. Click on the screen to see each step of the algorithm
4. If you wish, you can visualize step by step the triangulation by clicking on "See triangulation step by step"
5. The algorithms of Dobkin & Snyder can be accessed by clicking on "See Dobkin & Snyder algorithm" which lead to an other web page
6. On this webpage you can draw yourself as before a convex polygon or you can directly generate a polygon where the algorithm of Dobkin & Snyder fails
7. Click on the screen to see each step of the algorithm and at the end, compare this largest triangle with correct one  (both can be the same if you draw yourself the polygon)
